appFX:  A couple dozen applications to test out the components in JavaFX 8.<p>

 I found it difficult to research 
example code in JavaFX, because of the many historical versions in Javascript, so I thought it'd be useful to 
republish the valuable examples I downloaded, and the programs I've built with them so far.

This project contains a variety of apps based on JavaFX 8, both collected and original.  It is intended to be used with libFX, but many of the applications are independent of it.<p><p>

There are a lot of added charts, and an application that shows most of them in tabs.<p>
The Bindings Sandbox shows data edited by drag, text field and table cell, and tries to keep them in sync.<p>
A couple of drawing programs, both with Undo implemented.<p>
Snippets for a game program I never wrote, with a lot of drag and drop support. Includes working examples of ImageView, MediaView, HTMLEditor and a scroll pane of interspersed prompts and dynamically regrowing text fields<p>
Tables and cell factories for several different data types,.<p>
A database app with 5 separate tables, with a lot of forms and utilities to build forms.<p>
Dialogs came late to FX, so there are libraries out there that are no longer necessary.  Here's some examples of the new controls, as well as Find, Login, Connect, and Search templates.<p>
Turing Patterns is an image generation demo, based on cellular automata<p>
AppContainer shows a directory of your file system in a TreeTableView, and gives you a baby desktop to manage and open files.<p>
