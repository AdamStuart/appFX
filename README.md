# appFX
appFX:  A couple dozen applications to test out the components in JavaFX.<p>

 I found it difficult to research 
example code in JavaFX, because of the many historical versions in Javascript, so I thought it'd be useful to 
republish the valuable examples I downloaded, and the programs I've built with them so far.

This project contains a variety of apps based on JavaFX 8, both collected and original:

There are a lot of added charts, and an application that shows most of them in tabs.<p>
The Bindings Sandbox shows data edited by drag, text field and table cell, and tries to keep them in sync.<p>
A couple of drawing programs, both with Undo implemented.<p>
Snippets for a game program I never wrote, with a lot of drag and drop support.<p>
Table factories for several different data types.
A database app with 5 separate tables.
Dialogs came late to FX.  Here's some examples of the new controls, as well as Find, Login, Connect, and Search templates.<p>

Several third party sources are republished here. Copyrights are observed as best I could.<p>
Original code is (to be) shared under the Apache 2.0 copyright.
