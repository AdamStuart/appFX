Correlation between circulating CD27high plasma cells and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is usually assessed with complex disease activity scores comprising a variety of different parameters. In order to determine whether SLE disease activity correlates with abnormal B lymphocyte activity, B cell subsets were analyzed, and their relationship to clinical and humoral measures of disease activity was assessed.
The distribution of B cell subsets was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and assessed in relation to the autoantibody profile, disease activity measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure scores, disease duration, and therapy.
The number and frequency of CD27(high) plasma cells were significantly correlated with the SLE disease activity indices and with the titer of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibodies. Circulating B cell subsets were not influenced by age or sex, but appeared to relate to the duration of disease and the therapeutic regimen, with the number and frequency of CD27(high) plasma cells increasing and those of CD27- naive B cells decreasing over time. Patients were divided into those with a SLEDAI score of 0-8 (low disease activity) and those with SLEDAI score >8 (high disease activity). Patients with high disease activity had an increased frequency of both CD19+ B cells and CD27(high) plasma cells. By using a nonparametric data sieving algorithm, we observed that these B cell abnormalities provided predictive values for nonactive and 
active disease of 78.0% and 78.9%, respectively. The predictive value of the B cell abnormalities (78.9%) was greater than that of the humoral/clinical data pattern (71.4%), including anti-dsDNA antibody levels, circulating immune complexes, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, mucocutaneous involvement, and acute renal involvement.
Flow cytometric monitoring of B cell subsets in the peripheral blood provides new insights into abnormalities of 
B cell function in SLE and may also be a diagnostically valuable option for monitoring the activity of this autoimmune disease.

CD27 is a useful marker in assessing the number of circulating B cells and B cell subsets because it permits one 
step identification of the major B cell compartments, CD27- naïve and CD27+ memory B cells as well as CD27high plasma cells. 
Abnormalities in the distribution ofCD27+ B cell subsets are useful in assessing disease activity in patients with systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). In particular, the frequency of CD27high plasma cells 
significantly correlates with lupus activity in both children and adults with SLE. Conventional immunosuppressive 
therapies affect the number of CD27- naïve B cells and CD27high plasma cells, but do not target CD27+ memory B cells. 
These results suggest that disease flares may relate to the retention of CD27+ memory B cells after conventional 
immunosuppressive therapy and that new therapies that target these cells specifically may offer new opportunities to induce 
remission in SLE.


Activated memory B cell subsets correlate with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus: delineation by expression of CD27, IgD, and CD95.
Analysis of peripheral B cell subsets in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has provided evidence of specific alterations, such as an expansion of CD27++ plasma cells/blasts and transitional B cells. However, memory B cells in lupus have not been thoroughly 
investigated, and only recently a CD27- memory B cell subset was identified in the peripheral blood of lupus patients. Focusing on CD27- B cells, this study aimed to identify abnormalities in peripheral B cell subsets in patients with SLE.
METHODS:
Three independent cohorts of lupus patients were used to characterize CD27- memory B cells, using multiparameter 
flow cytometry and single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of heavy-chain transcripts.
RESULTS:
We identified a homogeneous subset of CD27-,IgD-,CD95+ memory B cells with an activated phenotype that was increased 
in patients with disease flares and that correlated with disease activity and serologic abnormalities. In contrast, 
the entire subset of CD27-,IgD- B cells was found to be heterogeneous, did not correlate significantly with lupus activity, and was also increased in patients with bacterial infections.
CONCLUSION:
We conclude that CD95 is a useful marker to identify CD27- memory B cells with an activated phenotype, which might 
serve as a biomarker for lupus activity and as a target of further investigations aiming to elucidate the pathogenic 
potential of these cells and the mechanisms involved in the generation as well as regulation of this CD27-,IgD-,CD95+ 
memory B cell subset.



Although B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) is effective in a subset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 
both mechanisms and biomarkers of response are poorly defined. Here we characterized abnormalities in 
B cell populations in RA and the impact of BCDT in order to elucidate B cell roles in the disease and 
response biomarkers. In active RA patients both CD27+IgD- switched memory (SM) and CD27-IgD- double 
negative memory (DN) peripheral blood B cells contained significantly higher fractions of CD95+ and CD21- activated 
cells compared to healthy controls. After BCD the predominant B cell populations were memory, and residual 
memory B cells displayed a high fraction of CD21- and CD95+ compared to pre-depletion indicating some 
resistance of these activated populations to anti-CD20. The residual memory populations also expressed more Ki-67 
compared to pre-treatment, suggesting homeostatic proliferation in the B cell depleted state. Biomarkers of clinical 
response included lower CD95+ activated memory B cells at depletion time points and a higher ratio of transitional 
B cells to memory at reconstitution. B cell function in terms of cytokine secretion was dependent on B cell subset 
and changed with BCD. Thus, SM B cells produced pro-inflammatory (TNF) over regulatory (IL10) cytokines as 
compared to naïve/transitional. Notably, B cell TNF production decreased after BCDT and reconstitution compared to 
untreated RA. Our results support the hypothesis that the clinical and immunological outcome of BCDT depends on 
the relative balance of protective and pathogenic 
B cell subsets established after B cell depletion and repopulation.

Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease [1, 2] associated with aggressive synovitis that over time causes bone, tendon, and cartilage damage. Although multiple cell types play a role in the pathogenesis of RA, the key participation of B cells has long been appreciated since the discovery of rheumatoid factor (RF) and has been re-highlighted over the past several years. Thus, RF and anti-cyclic-citrillunated peptide (anti-CCP) autoantibodies are well-established indicators of disease and disease severity and may precede the onset of disease by many years [3–5]. Although B cells have been considered important as producers of autoantibodies, their antibody independent roles and utility as a major therapeutic target have not been appreciated until more recently.

The efficacy of B cell depletion therapy (BCDT) highlights the pathogenic significance of B cells in RA [6–8]. Moreover, the dissociation between changes in autoantibodies and clinical efficacy points to the autoantibody independent roles of B cells in the disease. These may include antigen-presentation, T-cell activation/polarization, dendritic cell modulation, and formation of ectopic lymphoid structures [9–11] [12] and are mediated at least in part by the ability of B cells to produce cytokines [13]. However, the precise contribution of B cells to the disease process and in turn the mechanism(s) by which BCDT is efficacious in RA remain incompletely elucidated. B cells can contribute to autoimmunity via the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 [14, 15], but also may play a protective or regulatory role in the immune system likely depending on the particular subset and inflammatory milieu [16–18]. Recent provocative data in a multiple sclerosis murine model suggests that IL6 producing B cells contribute to T cell stimulation in the disease, including Th17 polarization, and BCDT ameliorated the disease only in mice with IL6-sufficient B cells. Notably, B cells from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients also produced more IL6, an abnormality that was normalized with B cell reconstitution after rituximab [19]. Given that the B cells reemerging after BCDT are dominated by CD27- naïve/transitional cells [20, 21], it is tempting to speculate that the cytokine normalization is related to a shift in the predominant B cell subsets present. However, which B cell subsets produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA, the contribution of B cell protective functions, and the potential plasticity of B cell function depending on environmental context remains unknown.

We have previously described that a B cell reconstitution with naïve/transitional cells is associated with sustained clinical remission in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) while a quick resurgence of memory cells portends a poor outcome [22, 23]. A number of publications have also found in RA that the detection of residual peripheral blood B cells using high sensitivity flow and the return of B cells, especially with higher fractions of memory B cells, increases the risk of inadequate response and/or relapse [24] [21, 25]. However, a critical question that remains to be addressed is whether the benefit of BCDT is directly mediated by the expanded transitional cells (a putative regulatory B cell subset [18, 26]) or instead reflects the absence of pro-inflammatory B cells or a combination of both. In this study, we followed RA patients longitudinally as they began BCDT in an effort to define the factors that regulate BCD and reconstitution and whether there are biomarkers that may predict response prior to or early after treatment. Of note, we find that active RA at baseline is associated with an activated peripheral blood B cell memory compartment. These memory B cell populations became dominant at depletion time points and displayed evidence of recent cell cycle entry, suggesting a resistance to depletion and homeostatic proliferation. Residual activated memory B cells at depletion time points correlated with incomplete clinical response. B cell repopulation began by 8 months in most patients regardless of response, but a higher ratio of transitional to memory B cells correlated with better clinical outcomes. Memory B cells had a greater propensity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines particularly TNF, and B cell TNF production was reduced after depletion and reconstitution. These results suggest that the outcome of B cell depletion therapy depends on the relative balance of protective and pathogenic B cell subsets established after B cell depletion and upon B cell repopulation.

Methods
Patient Population

Patients met ACR 1987 revised criteria for the classification of RA and had active disease such that rituximab (1000 mg x 2 two weeks apart) was being initiated clinically (see Table 1 for clinical characteristics of patients) [27]. Three of the patients had previously been treated with rituximab and were being re-treated because of disease flare. The mean baseline DAS28 (CRP) score was 4.94 (range 2.99 to 7.19) for the entire group, 4.97 for the rituximab naïve and 4.72 for the re-treated patients. Patients were clinically evaluated and blood was drawn for processing at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 20 months. The DAS response was determined at 4 months as follows: a decrease in the DAS response of ≥ 1.2 and a DAS ≤ 3.2 was considered a good responder, a decrease in DAS of < 0.6 or 0.6 to 1.2 with a DAS > 5.1 was considered a non-responder, and a moderate responder was between the two groups.

Ethics Statement

Subjects were recruited at the University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC). Detailed written informed consent was obtained from all patients (n = 20) and healthy donors (n = 24) in accordance with a protocol specifically approved by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB) of URMC for this study (Protocol RSRB #33286).

PBMC isolation and Flow Cytometry

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Immunofluorescence staining for flow cytometric analysis was performed by incubating PBMCs with optimally titrated concentrations of mAb in PBS/0.5% BSA on ice for 20 minutes after blocking with 10 μg of human IgG for 20 minutes. Cells were washed in PBS/BSA and incubated with streptavidin-conjugate, Aqua Live/Dead Stain (1:1000), and fixed in 0.5% Formaldehyde before analysis on a LSRII Cytometer with a three-laser (Blue/Red/Violet lasers) configuration (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). We used 2 different panels of 12-color/14-parameter flow cytometry with well-validated Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that incorporate extensive Quality Assessment and Quality Controls as previously described [28]. These multicolor panels share seven anchor markers including antibodies against CD19 and CD3, along with the Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain, to allow the unambiguous identification of live CD19+CD3- B cells. The inclusion of four developmental markers (IgD, CD24, CD27 and CD38) in the same panel makes it feasible to compare and integrate different B cell classification schemes and provide precise identification of the core human B cell subpopulations as further described below. Beads were used as compensation controls (Simply Cellular Compensation Standard, Bangs Laboratories) and FMO controls (Fluorescent minus one) were utilized to define positive expression. Application-specific PMT settings for the LSRII Cytometer were determined for each panel to allow for maximal separation of signal from background and minimal spillover from other fluorochromes into each detector. In addition to the daily instrument calibration with CST beads (BD), the Rainbow Calibration Peak 6 Particles (Spherotech) was run through the Cytometer before each data acquisition to ensure proper instrument performance.

Lymphocytes were gated through the FSC-A vs SSC-A plot and further interrogated by the ratios of Height to Width in forward scatter and side scatter. B cells were identified based on CD19 expression, exclusion of CD3, and gating out cell aggregates and dead cells. Naïve B cells were distinguished from transitional cells and memory B cells by the expression of ABCB1 transporter activity and Mitotracker dye extrusion as described [29]. Briefly, cells were stained in culture medium at 37°C with Mitotracker at 20 nM and chased for 30 minutes prior to flow cytometry analysis. Transitional B cells within the gated IgD+CD27- population were distinguished by the intermediate/high expression of Mitotracker. Additional delineation of early T1/T2 and later T3 transitional populations was based on the relative expression of CD38 and CD24 compared to precursor bone marrow B cell populations as previously described [23]. The incorporation of CD21 and CD95 in the memory panel can provide additional information regarding the activation status of both the CD27+ switched memory (SM) and CD27- memory B cells. Thus, loss of CD21 and up-regulation of CD95 have been independently associated with memory B cell activation [30, 31]. B cells in PBMCs were additionally classified by multi-parameter flow cytometry along a developmental pathway based on the expression of defined surface markers as follows: early transitional (IgD- CD27- CD24+++CD38+++), Transitional 1/2 (IgD+ CD27- MTG+ CD24++/+++CD38++/+++), Transitional 3 (IgD+ CD27- MTG+ CD24+ CD38+), naive (IgD+ CD27- MTG- CD24+CD38+), CD27+ switched memory (IgD- CD27+), CD27- switched memory (IgD- CD27-) (DN), and unswitched memory (IgD+ CD27+). Plasma cells/blasts were included in the CD27+ switched memory compartment as further defined in the figure legends [6, 32–35].

For B cell flow cytometry, 5 million cells were stained with all events collected (minimum of 500,000 events) in order to provide a high sensitivity analysis with the lower limit of detection 0.1 cells/μl [24, 36]. Absolute cell numbers were calculated based on the white blood cell count, the percentage of lymphocytes, and the percentage of CD19 cells identified on flow cytometry. B cell depletion and reconstitution were defined as < or > 5 cells/μl, respectively.

Sort purification

B cell were enriched from peripheral blood using RosetteSep (Stem Cell Technology), stained with CD19, CD27, IgD and mitotracker, and sorted into unswitched memory (IgD+CD27+), switched memory (IgD-CD27+), mature naïve (IgD+CD27-MTG-), and transitional (IgD+CD27-MTG+) CD19+ B cells (13-color FACSAria-liu, BD Biosciences).

Cytokine Assays and Ki67 expression

Sorted B cells (100,000) were cultured with 2.5 μg/ml CPG 2006, 2.5 μg/ml anti-CD40, and 50 U/ml IL-2. After 4 days, the B cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA, 1 μg/ml Ionomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml of Golgi Plug for 4.5 hours. Cells were stained including for intracellular expression of TNF and IL10 and analyzed on a three-laser 12-color LSRII (BD Biosciences).

In other experiments, PBMCs were aliquoted into 1 million per 100 μl of RPMI and stimulated with 200 ng/ml PMA and 2 μg/ml Ionomycin with the addition of 1 μl/ml Golgi Plug and 0.68 μl/ml Golgi Stop at 37°C for 4 hours. The PBMCs were surfaced stained for CD19 and followed with live dead staining. Cells were fixed and internally stained for TNF, IL-17, IFN-γ IL2, IL6, IL-10, CD3, CD4, and Foxp3 (eBioscience). Cells were analyzed on a three-laser 12-color LSRII (BD Biosciences).

Unstimulated PBMCs were surface stained for IgD, CD24, CD21, CD38, CD19, CD20, CD27, CD95, and CD3, followed by live/dead stain, fixation, and antibody against Ki-67. Cells were analyzed on a three-laser 12-color LSRII (BD Biosciences).

Statistical analysis

The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare mean values between pairs of groups. Three group comparisons were conducted using non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis). Paired t-test was performed on paired samples after testing for normality. All tests were two-sided and P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software.

Expansion of memory B cell populations in active RA

As an initial analysis of the B cell compartment, we first examined the four canonical B cell subsets revealed by CD27 and IgD expression. When RA pre-BCDT were compared to age-matched healthy controls, the total naïve (IgD+CD27-) (includes transitional B cells), unswitched memory (IgD+CD27+), CD27+ switched memory (IgD-CD27+) (includes plasmablasts), and CD27- DN memory (IgD-CD27-) subsets were similar (Fig 1A). However, notably there were significantly more activated B cell populations in RA as revealed by up-regulation of CD95 and down-regulation of CD21 (Fig 1B). Thus, the CD95+ populations in the SM and DN were significantly higher in the RA patients (p = 0.0020 and p<0.0001, respectively). The CD21- populations in the SM and DN were also significantly higher (p = 0.0010 and p = 0.0392, respectively). Therefore, activated CD95+ and CD21- memory B cells were expanded in active RA compared to age-matched healthy controls.

Expansion of activated memory B cells in active RA patients.
Memory B cells predominate initially following rituximab treatment

After BCDT, all subjects depleted to <5 cells/μl (lower limit of detection 0.1 cells/ μl). At depletion time points, the circulating residual B cell populations were predominately of a memory phenotype (IgD-: DN and SM). An example of this finding is depicted in Fig 2A for a typical subject. For the group as a whole, as early as 1 month following BCDT the DN B cell population was relatively expanded compared to both control and baseline and remained so until after B cell reconstitution (healthy control vs. 1–8 months p<0.0001; RA baseline vs. 1–4 months p<0.0001 and 8 month p = 0.0049) (Fig 2C). From 1 to 8 months post-BCDT the relative SM B cell population progressively increased (8 month p = 0.0315 compared to RA baseline) (Fig 2C). Interestingly, once B cell reconstitution was underway (defined as >5 cells/μl and discussed in more detail later) the overall SM B cells were significantly lower than baseline (%SM: 20 months p = 0.0434 and 24 months p = 0.0401) (Fig 2C) (absolute SM baseline 12.39±11.61 cells/μl vs. 1 month nadir 0.25±0.52 cells/μl vs. 20 months 4.5 ± 0.7 cells/μl and 24 month 3.69±1.80 cells/μl). Although absolute numbers of SM and DN did decrease after BCD, there were significant residual B cells (especially DN) compared to the naïve compartment (S1 Fig).

Fig 2
Fig 2
Memory B cell populations become dominant following rituximab treatment.
The baseline expansion in activated B cell populations became even more pronounced after BCDT in both the DN and SM (Fig 2B). The CD95+ subset of SM B cells remained significantly higher than controls throughout the duration of the study (to month 24) (Fig 2D). Curiously, during B cell reconstitution (2 months on), this population expanded further and remained higher through 24 months (significantly higher than baseline %: 2 month p = 0.0110, 4 month p<0.0001, 8 month p = 0.0015, 12 month p = 0.0007, 16 month p = 0.0132, 20 month p = 0.0012, and 24 months p = 0.0118) (absolute CD95+ SM baseline 5.65±3.86 cells/μl vs. 1 month nadir 1.43±5.56 cells/μl vs. 16 months 1.92±1.55 cells/μl vs. 20 months 2.15±1.42 cells/μl and 24 months 3.12±1.38). The fraction of CD95+ B cells in the DN population remained higher than controls through 24 months post-BCD. Interestingly, the CD21- expansion within the SM and DN B cells became more pronounced immediately after BCD and persisted through B cell reconstitution (SM: significantly higher than controls through 24 months, months 1–12 p<0.0001, 16 month p = 0.0156, 20 month p = 0.0001 and significantly higher than baseline at months 1–8 p<0.0001 and 12 month p = 0.0017 and again at months 20 p = 0.0138 and 24 months 0.0223) (DN: significantly higher than controls through 12 months, months 1–8 p<0.0001, months 12 p = 0.0472 and significantly higher than baseline at months 1–4 p<0.0001) (Fig 2D). Overall, this data suggested that memory B cells were relatively more resistant to BCD compared to other B cell populations. This is also reflected in the analysis of absolute numbers of cells where activated memory B cell depletion is much less robust compared to the naïve B cell compartment (S1 Fig). The differences in the kinetics of depletion and reconstitution of discrete memory B cell subsets (SM vs. DN and CD95+ vs. CD21-) is interesting and may have multiple explanations including differences in pathways of generation, re-circulation kinetics, and homeostatic proliferation.

Residual memory B cells in RA following BCDT express the proliferation antigen Ki-67

To begin to explore whether residual memory B cells may undergo homeostatic proliferation in the lymphopenic environment, we examined the expression of Ki-67, a nuclear antigen that identifies cells recently entering the cell cycle). The SM and DN memory B cell subsets had high expression of Ki-67 during the depleted state as compared to the healthy controls (SM %Ki67+ RA depleted 63.5±4.7% vs. HC 23.0±6.1, p = 0.0017 and DN %Ki67+ RA depleted 39.86±8.1% vs. HC 22.3±4.2, p = 0.05) (mean±SEM) (Fig 3A and 3B).

Fig 3
Fig 3
Residual memory B cells in RA following BCDT upregulate Ki67.
Ki-67 results suggest homeostatic proliferation of memory B cells after B cell depletion therapy. To ensure that these findings were truly a reflection of BCD and not the RA disease process, we compared an independent cohort of (untreated) RA patients and found no differences from healthy controls (e.g. SM %Ki67+ RA untreated 15.95±4.6% vs. HC 23.0±6.1) (Fig 3B). In contrast, RA post-BCD had significantly higher Ki67 expression compared to untreated RA in both the SM (63.5±4.7% vs. 17.2±4.6, p = 0.005) and DN compartments (39.9±8.1% vs. 11.5±2.1, p = 0.05). Another explanation for these findings could be a shift in the frequency of B cells of varying proliferation states before and after BCDT. Interestingly, CD95+ B cells overall have higher Ki67 expression (Fig 3C) (HC CD95+ vs. CD95-: DN p = 0.005, SM p = 0.0118), with very little expression in CD95- memory B cells from healthy controls and untreated RA. However, an increase in Ki67 expression was seen post-BCD in both the CD95+ and CD95- populations with CD95+ significantly higher than CD95- (DN: p = 0.0027 and SM p = 0.0002), suggesting that elevated Ki67 is related to the B cell depleted state (Fig 3C). Further supporting the conclusion that B cells proliferate following BCD, Ki67 expression significantly increased in multiple subsets (SM, USM, N) in a subset of patients followed longitudinally (Fig 3D).

Sequential depletion and repopulation of B cells after BCD

The naïve/transitional compartment (N/T) (IgD+CD27-) was rapidly depleted by 1-month post BCDT in all subjects (<5 cells/μl in all, mean absolute N/T 4.74±17.6, mean total absolute B cells 5.54±18.8) and remained depleted for 4 months (<5 cells/μl) (N/T %: baseline vs. month 1, 2, 4 p<0.0001) (Fig 4). Reconstitution varied between patients beginning between 4 and 16 months (11% of subjects with >5 naïve cells/μl at 4 months, 80% 8 months, 89% by 12 months), with significantly higher naïve/transitional B cell fractions compared to baseline beginning at 16 months (baseline vs. 16 month p = 0.0137, 20 month p = 0.0062, 24 month p = 0.0037) (Fig 4A).

Fig 4
Fig 4
Sequential repopulation of B cells in RA patients after B cell depletion.
The naïve/transitional subset is composed of T1, T2, T3, and mature naïve B cells [23]. Reconstitution occurred sequentially, with the T1/T2 fraction appearing first, followed by T3, and finally the mature naive. The T1/T2 compartment remained expanded relative to baseline from months 12 through 16 (month 12 p = .0245 and month 16 p = 0.149) and the T3 from month 12 through 24 (12 month p = 0.0426, month 16 p = 0.0132 month 20 p = 0.0386, month 24 p = 0.0029) (Fig 4B).

Biomarkers of clinical response

As previously reported in the literature, patient response to rituximab was variable. The DAS response patient breakdown at 4 months was as follows: good- 20%, moderate- 35%, and non-responder- 45%. The extent and length of depletion and reconstitution varied from patient to patient. However, there was no clear relationship between the depth of depletion at 1 or 2 months and the clinical response. In our cohort, all subjects depleted to <5 cells/μl, but all still had detectable B cells by high sensitivity flow (lower limit of detection 0.1 cells/μl) (Fig 5 and S1 Fig). Overall, reconstitution occurred with similar kinetics in the good, moderate, and non-responders, as did the reconstitution of SM B cells (Fig 5A, 8 months). Notably, however, the CD95+ subsets of DN and SM were significantly lower at 4 months in the good responders compared to both moderate and non-responders (Fig 5B). The CD21- subsets of SM and DN were not significantly different between responder groups. Baseline levels of CD95+ and CD21- in both the SM and DN B cells also were not predictive of DAS response (data not shown). Notably, the ratio of transitional to memory B cells at 8 months was significantly higher in the good responders (Fig 5A).
