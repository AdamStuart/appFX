Capital Structure

        The articles usually contain a description of the capital structure of the cooperative. If stock is issued, the number of shares authorized and the par value of each share of each class of stock (common, preferred) are set forth. The rights granted owners of each class of stock, the restrictions on owners of each class, and the dividends to which each class is entitled are also explained.
        If stock is not issued, a description must be included of how the rights and interests of the members will be determined. Sample language for both a stock and a nonstock association is provided below.
        The capital stock example provides for both voting common and nonvoting preferred stock. Nonvoting preferred stock is a useful way to account for additional nonpatronage investments by members. It has also been used as a way of raising equity from nonmembers, such as other members of the community interested in supporting the cooperative. If any interest in the cooperative is being sold to nonmembers, counsel must be retained to advise the association on applicable securities law requirements.
        The sample language also assumes that the organization limits each member to one vote. If proportional voting based on patronage is utilized, counsel will have to prepare a description of how votes will be accumulated and any limit on the number of votes any one member can amass.
        All of the information in the example below is important and should be included somewhere in the organizational documents. However, not all incorporation laws require that all of it be in the articles. It may be possible to place some of these provisions in the bylaws.
