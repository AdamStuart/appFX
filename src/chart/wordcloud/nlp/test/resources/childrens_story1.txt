In the village of Tubondo lived a great chief. His name was She-Mwindo.

One day he called together his seven wives and his counselors and all his people. He told them, “When a daughter marries, her family is paid a bride-price. But when a son marries, it is his family that pays it. So, all my children must be daughters. If any is a son, I will kill him.”

The people were astonished. But they said nothing, for they were afraid of him.

Soon all the chief’s seven wives became pregnant. The children of six wives arrived on the same day. They were all daughters. But the child of his favorite wife did not arrive.

The child that did not arrive was Mwindo. He was not ready to arrive.

At last he told himself, “I am ready. But I will not come out like other babies. I will come out through my mother’s navel.”

His mother lay in bed. He came out through her navel. He jumped down and ran around the room. In his hand was a conga flyswatter, with a handle of wood and a swatter of buffalo tail.

His mother cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What kind of child is this?”

The baby sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father She-Mwindo does not want me.
    My father the chief wants to kill me.
    But what can he do against me?

She-Mwindo heard the noise. He went to the house of his favorite wife. He saw the boy and was full of rage. “What is this? Did I not say ‘no sons’? Did I not say I would kill him?”

He threw his spear at the baby. Mwindo waved his conga. The spear fell short and stuck in the floor. Mwindo pulled it up. He broke it in two.

She-Mwindo cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What kind of child is this?”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    O my father, you do not want me.
    O my father, you try to kill me.
    But what can you do against me?

The chief rushed out. He called his counselors. “My favorite wife has given birth to a son. I cannot spear him. But I can bury him. Dig a grave and put him in.”

The counselors said nothing. They dug a grave. They put Mwindo at the bottom. They threw in the dirt.

The day was done. Everyone went to sleep. The next morning, the chief woke up. He heard a song.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father does not want me.
    My father tried to bury me.
    But what can he do against me?

The chief rushed from his house. He went to the grave. It was all dug up. He went to the house of his favorite wife. The baby was on her lap.

She-Mwindo cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What kind of child is this?”

He went and called his counselors. “I cannot spear the child. I cannot bury him. But I can float him down the river. Make a drum and put him in.”

The counselors said nothing. They cut a piece of log and hollowed it. They prepared two antelope hides. They placed the baby inside. They laced and pegged the hides.

The chief took the drum to the river. He threw it far out. He looked to see it float downstream.

The drum did not float downstream. It floated just where it was. The chief heard a song.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    O my father, you do not want me.
    O my father, you send me downriver.
    What is downriver?
    Nothing for Mwindo!
    What is upriver?
    Something for Mwindo—
    my father’s sister,
    my aunt Iyangura.
    My father does not want me,
    but my aunt will want me.
    Mwindo will not go downriver,
    Mwindo will go upriver.
    Mwindo goes where he wants to go.

The drum floated upstream. She-Mwindo cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What kind of child is this?” Then he said, “But now he’s gone.” He returned to the village.

Mwindo went upstream. He was going to Aunt Iyangura. He came near her village. He floated his drum to the bank.

The serving girls of Iyangura came to draw water. They saw the drum and heard a song.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father did not want me.
    My father tried to kill me.
    But Aunt Iyangura will want me.

The girls rushed to tell Iyangura. She came running. With a knife, she slashed open the drum. There was the baby with his conga. Iyangura was astonished. He shone like the rising sun.

Iyangura said, “What a fine boy is Mwindo! How could my brother reject him? Iyangura will not reject him!” She picked him up. She carried him to her house and cared for him.
