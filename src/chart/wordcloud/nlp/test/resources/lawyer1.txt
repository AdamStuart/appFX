The State statute authorizing formation of a cooperative will set out in detail the activities the cooperative may engage in. As a general rule, the statutory language is copied virtually verbatim into the articles. The following is an example of a typical statutory provision restated as an article of incorporation:

ARTICLE IV. POWERS

            This association shall have the following powers:

                        (a) To borrow money without limitation as to amount of corporate indebtedness or liability; to give a lien on any of its property as security therefore in any manner permitted by law; and to make advance payments and advances to members and other producers.

                        (b) To act as the agent or representative of any member or members in any of the activities mentioned in Article III hereof.

                        (c) To buy, lease, hold, and exercise all privileges of ownership over such real or personal property as may be necessary or convenient for the conduct and operation of the business of the association, or incidental thereto.

                        (d) To draw, make, accept, endorse, guarantee, execute, and issue promissory notes, bills of exchange, drafts, warrants, certificates, and all kinds of obligations and negotiable or transferable instruments for any purpose that is deemed to further the objects for which this association is formed, and to give a lien on any of its property as security therefor.

                        (e) To acquire, own, and develop any interest in patents, trademarks, and copyrights connected with, or incidental to, the business of the association.

                        (f) To cooperate with other similar associations in creating central, regional, or national cooperative agencies, for any of the purposes for which this association is formed, and to become a member or stockholder of such agencies as now are or hereinafter may be in existence.

                        (g) To have and exercise, in addition to the foregoing, all powers, privileges, and rights conferred on ordinary corporations and cooperative marketing associations by the laws of this State and all powers and rights incidental or conducive to carrying out the purpose for which this association is formed, except such as are inconsistent with the express provisions of the act under which this association is incorporated, and to do any such thing anywhere; and the enumeration of the foregoing powers shall not be held to limit or restrict in any manner the general powers which may by law be possessed by this association, all of which are hereby expressly claimed.
