Finding a Book to Chew and Digest

“Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed and some to be chewed on and digested.” ~Sir Francis Bacon

Finding a book that is thoroughly engaging might sound easy; however, it is not that simple. There are three principal elements that make a story magnificent. With descriptive, vivid details and language, a comprehensible story line with exactly the right pacing, and a satisfying plot that has a moral and touches your heart, you will find a novel that will be glued to your hands. Once you know what to look for in a book, reading will be most satisfying.

To begin with, descriptive language and detail play an important role in an exceptional story. Without these elements, the novel becomes uninteresting. A book could say, “The dog ran fast,” but how interesting is that? Instead, the story could say, “The big brown Collie sprinted as rapidly as a cheetah down the freshly paved street.”  Those details give you a picture in your mind.  If the story you are reading does not have outstanding word choice and descriptive details, put it down immediately and find a more impressive book.

Of equal importance is choosing a novel with an understandable story line and incredible pacing. That can make the difference between a book you never want to put down and one you would not pick up even if it was the only book in the universe and you were stranded alone on an uninhabited, unexplored planet. Remarkable pacing is a vital element because if the book flips back and forth through time or moves too slowly or too quickly, it will not make sense. If the pacing is perfect, but you feel that the story has crumbled, it may be because there are too many characters, too many sub plots, too few details, or too much description, all of which make the story line impossible to comprehend. As you can see, vivid language that gives strong description and smooth pacing are critical elements to make a novel fabulously entertaining.

The final thing that makes a book extraordinary is an amazing plot to which you can relate.  If you have ever had a book that bores you to death it is probably because the story did not have an engaging plot.  The plot must have an engaging beginning and a quick start, characters that are well-developed so that you care about them, and a universal conflict to the theme that reels you in and makes you eager to know the resolution.  The story should touch your heart and teach you something so that you will not want to put down the book.  You, the reader, should learn something about yourself or the world in general.  That is the final element that makes a book outstanding!

Now that you know what critical elements a suitable story contains, you can choose an intriguing, excellent book to read for yourself.  You will not only find one that you will simply taste and swallow, but one that chew and digest for quite some time.  Remember to look for a book with a superior plot with good pacing.  Hunt for a story with vivid descriptive language that creates pictures in your mind.  Look for a novel that you can follow without getting left behind.  Before you know it, you will be caught inside the book.  You might be in danger of becoming a crocodile’s dinner or being stranded on a deserted island.  Find the perfect book for you, start your adventure, making sure that your book’s plot touches your heart and helps you grow as a person.  Remember, in the words of some wise anonymous person, “The road to knowledge begins with the turn of the page.”
