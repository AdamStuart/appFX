I went camping and we ate lunch outside. I got to drive the motorhome when I went camp-
ing and we stopped and got some cheeseburgers and some orange pop and we got back on
the road. Then we went to bed. Then I woke up and I walked around. Then I went inside
and then when I was in the motorhome I had lunch.
