My Heroic Friend

Though my hero doesn’t fly like Superman or crawl like Spiderman, her cape of heroism is hidden under her benevolence.  Heroes are people you look up to, people who are your role models.  A hero should set good examples.  My hero is my best friend, Erin.  Erin is my hero because she taught me manners.  She is my role model because I learned how to have fun from her, how to be confident and let loose.  My last reason why Erin is my hero is because she does not give up on me.

Usually, parents teach their kids manners, but not in my case.  Well, yeah, sure, my mom tried to teach me, but I actually learned from my best friend, Erin.  She taught me manners in a way parents have never thought of.  When Erin and I were little kids, all the parents loved her because of her manners.  I became jealous because all the parents adored Erin due to her politeness.  So I thought that if I had those same manners, parents would think I was even more adorable.  When Erin agreed to help me with my manners, whenever I forgot to say, “Thank you,” she would automatically say, “You’re welcome.”  Personally, I thought it was kind of funny, but it helped.  That’s why Erin is my personal hero.  I want to be more like her.

When I was little, I was a quiet girl until I met Erin.  Erin is a ball of energy that never wears out.  It’s like she drinks Rock Stars nonstop.  She taught me to loosen up, to have fun, and to take pride and have confidence in who I am.  Without her, I would just be some girl, not knowing her inner self, but instead, I stand out, and I’m different.  I also wouldn’t have a had a sense of humor.  Some people may not think of that as a characteristic for a hero, but to me, it changed my life.  Without a sense of humor, I wouldn’t have the same friends I have today.  When I’m with Erin, I forget the problems of my life.  I look up to her because she gave me confidence, and it’s incredibly important to have confidence.  It is something that will help you everywhere.  Erin is my personal hero because of her unique qualities.

Though friends come and go from time to time, Erin has been there for me since we were born (literally).  Even though we’re in different grades, it somehow keeps us closer.  Once we were at dance class, and everybody could do their double pirouette except for me.  Everybody went to go celebrate except Erin.  She was at home with me, supporting me while I perspired and persevered in trying to do a double pirouette.  To me that proves that Erin doesn’t give up on me.  She always helps me and puts others before her.  That’s my last reason why Erin is my heroic hero and why I look up to her.

In conclusion, my best friend, Erin, is my personal hero.  She taught me manners and how to be a polite young girl.  In addition, she taught me to have confidence in myself.  Erin is like a money tree:  You get more than you bargain for.  Erin never gives up on me, no matter what.  Personally, Erin is my hero, my role model, and the person I look up to.  After all the things she has done for me, I want to give back, even though good karma is definitely coming her way.  I want to thank my best friend, Erin, for being my hero.
