Off-the-Rail Rules for Amusement Parks

“I don’t want the public to see the world they live in while they’re in the park.  I want them to feel they’re in another world.” ~ Walt Disney

Some amusement parks are adequately acceptable; some are gloriously great! But the most exceptionally excellent amusement park must contain several key elements to transport you into a world filled with adventure, enjoyment, and imagination. Without rolling rides, soul-saving safety, fantastic food, and willing workers, a park cannot be extraordinary. These critical components keep a park in ship-shape condition for attendees and put the amusement in amusement park.

Obviously, an outstanding amusement park must include adrenaline-pumping rides. There must be rides with heaps of thrilling turns that climb to astounding heights. Furthermore, an extravagant ride must include breath-taking drops, screaming turns, rapid corkscrews, gravity-defying loops, and sudden blackouts. Such features make your heart beat rapidly and add to the excitement of the day. Picture the clinkety clank of the chain pulling your very soul up to the roller coaster’s apex.  Feel the cold air kissing your face as murmurs of fear and anticipation fight in your ears with the sound of your racing pulse.  Now you have reached the summit.  Time stands still.  This moment might last forever as you fearfully stare at the drop that appears as if it never ends.  Suddenly, you bolt forward.  Screams pierce the air as your stomach rises into your mouth.  Your hair stands on end as you dart through sharp turns and corkscrews.  Your backside raises out of the seat as you are turned upside down before plummeting back to earth, racing into the station with a neck-jerking halt.  The ride is over, and you hastily wobble off, catching your breath, to the next astonishing ride.  Clearly, a marvelous amusement park must have rides that take you on a journey to the world of extreme.  No matter what, you must leave the park exhilarated, but feeling like jello.

To go along with those fantastic rides, an amusement park must be strong in safety. Without safety, people could get seriously injured rather than experiencing pleasure in the park. Rides like roller coasters need the basic restraints such as bars, harnesses, and seat belts. Perhaps these rides should even be equipped with a barf bag!  Amusement parks could also have height limits, so short children will not fly out of their seats. Just imagine bumper cars without seat belts, with a person hurling toward you at twenty miles per hour and crashing into you. Ouch, right? You are suddenly jolted forward, without something to keep you from doing just that. Or think of experiencing a gravity-defying plummet without a bar that you can hold onto and that keeps you firmly planted in your seat. Yikes! Maybe even picture a loop-de-loop without a harness. Soon, you might be face-first on the cement. Double ouch! Safety may indeed be the most important component of an out-of-this-world amusement park.

Likewise, an exciting amusement park must have delicious, mouth-watering food that will make your taste-buds sing after you eat it!  No amusement park is complete without extraordinary foods. Finding exquisite food should not be challenging.  Eateries that cater to every possible taste should be conveniently located throughout the park.  After you have experienced a large amount of thrills from the rides, you must be able to take a break to quench your thirst with a glass of lemonade.  You must also be able to sprinkle your nose with powdered sugar while filling your stomach with delectable delights such as funnel cakes and churros.  If you need a little protein to get your energy back before embarking on more adventure, you should be able to fuel up on juicy burgers or the cheesiest pizza.  Even though most of this food isn’t healthy, you must be able to enjoy a tasty treat after your long day at the amusement park. An awesome amusement park absolutely must have scrumptious food!

In order to keep your moods up in an amusement park, the park must have cheerful employees who smile a mile a minute. Who wants to have mopey workers, who are as rude and droopy as angry, disappointed lions that just lost a fight, to ruin your exciting day? For example, when a park visitor cannot find a ride and an employee hands him/her a map and continues to do what he or she was doing, that visitor may feel underappreciated and disgruntled. What really should happen is that the employee should hand the guest a free map and offer to escort that person to the ride in question. Blissful workers will always make your day at an amusement park a mite more magnificent!!!

To conclude, there are four impeccable elements that every amusement park must have in order to be outstanding.  Look for these elements in real amusement parks to see if they meet all of the sophisticated standards for a stellar amusement park. Remember, though, that some amusement parks are acceptable, and some are great!  However, the most excellent amusement parks must contain these key elements: rolling rides, soul-saving safety, fantastic foods, and willing workers. These critical components are the things necessary in making an amusement park the BEST OF THE BEST!  So, in the words of the marketing man from Six Flags, “Start dreaming of screaming!”
