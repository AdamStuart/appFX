Hawk led them to the kikoka. Mwindo said, “O my aunt, good-bye. Wait for me till you see me.” Everyone wept.

Mwindo pulled up the kikoka and crawled through the hole. He was underground, in the land of the gods. He started to the village of Nyamurairi. The land was cold and gray, without sun or moon or stars.

He came to the place where the women draw water. There was Kahindo, the chief god’s daughter. Mwindo was astonished. She shone like the rising sun.

Kahindo saw him. “What a splendid young man is Mwindo! I welcome you.” She embraced him a long time. She said, “What has brought you to the land of the gods?”

Mwindo said, “I come to bring home my father.”

Kahindo said, “No one can do this. Only the dead come here, and none return.”

He said, “I will do it.”

She told him, “My father will try to trick you. He will offer you beer. You must say, ‘Though I am your guest, shall I drink water that has passed through my host?’ He will offer you porridge. You must say, ‘Though I am your guest, shall I eat food that has passed through my host?’ Say these things and you will be safe.”

Mwindo went into the village. He came to the house of Nyamurairi, the chief. The god sat on a stool by the fire. He was an old man with a long beard. He smoked a clay pipe and wore a white goatskin. “Greetings, Mwindo. What has brought you to the land of the gods?”

Mwindo said, “I come to bring home my father.”

The god said, “No one can do this. Only the dead come here, and none return. Your father cannot return. You too cannot return.”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father went to the gods.
    Mwindo went there too.
    O god of fire,
    even you cannot stop me.
    O god of death,
    even you cannot hold me.
    What can you do against me?
    Mwindo goes where he wants to go.

The god said, “Is this so? We will see about it. But you have come far. You are thirsty. You must have beer.” He held out a cup.

Mwindo said, “Though I am your guest, shall I drink water that has passed through my host?”

The god said, “You are right! But you have come far. You are hungry. You must have porridge.” He held out a bowl.

Mwindo said, “Though I am your guest, shall I eat food that has passed through my host?”

The god was astonished. “What a clever young man is Mwindo! We must see more of his skill. At sunrise you will start a banana grove. By sundown you will bring ripe bananas. If you do, you can take home your father.”

Mwindo spent the night in the house of Kahindo. At dawn, Nyamurairi came. He gave Mwindo a billhook knife and an ax and a bundle of banana shoots. He showed the place in the forest for the banana grove. He left him there.

Mwindo put the things down—the billhook, the ax, the banana shoots. He swatted the billhook with his conga—once, twice, three times. He said, “First you rest, now you work.” The billhook jumped up. It cleared the brush from between the trees.

Mwindo swatted the ax—once, twice, three times. “First you rest, now you work.” The ax jumped up. It cut the trees down.

Mwindo swatted the banana shoots—once, twice, three times. “First you rest, now you work.” The shoots jumped up. They planted themselves and grew.

Mwindo lay down and rested. The banana trunks grew tall. They flowered. They bore fruit. The fruit ripened. The billhook cut it down.

Mwindo got up. He carried the bananas to Nyamurairi. The sun set.

The god was astonished. “What a clever young man is Mwindo! We must see more of his skill. Tomorrow you will gather honey from a certain tree. If you do, you can take home your father.”

Mwindo spent the night in the house of Kahindo. At dawn, Nyamurairi came. He gave Mwindo a torch and an ax and a calabash. He showed him the honey tree. He left him there.

Mwindo climbed the tree. With the torch, he smoked out the bees. With the ax, he chopped an opening. But he could not reach the honey.

Mwindo climbed down. He sang and danced and waved his conga.

    O Lightning, look here.
    O Lightning, be the judge.
    Is the god right?
    Is Mwindo right?
    Without your bolt,
    there is no honey.
    Without honey,
    there is no father.
    O Lightning, send your bolt.
    Show who’s right,
    show who’s wrong.

Lightning sent his bolt. It split the tree. Mwindo climbed up and reached the honey. He put it in the calabash. He brought it to Nyamurairi.

The god was astonished. “What a clever young man is Mwindo! We must reward his skill. O Mwindo, take this gift—my belt of cowrie shells.”

Nyamurairi took off his belt. He threw it at Mwindo. It wrapped itself around him. It squeezed him. Mwindo could not pull it off. Mwindo could not breathe. He dropped his conga. He fell to the ground. He died. His body lay in the dust.

The god laughed. “What a foolish boaster is Mwindo! Did the god of fire not stop him? Did the god of death not hold him?”

He saw the conga rise up. He cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What is this?”

The conga swatted the belt—once, twice, three times. The belt dropped away. The conga swatted Mwindo—once, twice, three times. Mwindo breathed. He rose and took the conga.

Mwindo picked up the belt. He threw it at Nyamurairi. It wrapped itself around him. It squeezed him. The god could not pull it off. The god could not breathe. He fell to the ground. He died. His body lay in the dust.

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga,

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father went to the gods.
    Mwindo went there too.
    The god of fire tried to stop me,
    but Mwindo stopped the god.
    The god of death tried to hold me,
    but Mwindo held the god.
    What could he do against me?
    Mwindo goes where he wants to go.
    The son will find his father.
    The father will face his son.

Kahindo came there. She saw the god lying in the dust. “What is this? O Mwindo, you came to bring home your father. But now my father is dead!”

Mwindo stopped dancing. He was sad to see Nyamurairi dead. He swatted him with his conga—once, twice, three times. “First you sleep, now you wake.”

Nyamurairi woke. He said, “What a great man is Mwindo! What can anyone do against you? Take home your father.”

Mwindo said, “Where is he?”

Hawk flew down. “O Mwindo, your father runs away again!”
