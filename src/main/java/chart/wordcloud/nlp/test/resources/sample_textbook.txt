The following text samples primarily serve to exemplify the level of complexity and quality that the
Standards r
equire all students in a given grade band to engage with. Additionally, they are suggestive of
the breadth of texts that students should encounter in the text types required by the Standards. The
choices should serve as useful guideposts in helping educato
rs select texts of similar
complexity
,
quality
,
and
range
for their own classrooms. They expressly do
not
represent a partial or complete reading list.
The process of text selection was guided by the following criteria:
Complexity.
Appendix A describes in
detail a three
-
part model of measuring text complexity
based on qualitative and quantitative indices of inherent text difficulty balanced with educators’
professional judgment in matching readers and texts in light of particular tasks. In selecting texts
to serve as exemplars, the work group began by soliciting contributions from teachers,
educational leaders, and researchers who have experience working with students in the grades
for which the texts have been selected. These contributors were asked to rec
ommend texts that
they or their colleagues have used successfully with students in a given grade band. The work
group made final selections based in part on whether qualitative and quantitative measures
indicated that the recommended texts were of sufficie
nt complexity for the grade band. For
those types of texts
—
particularly poetry and multimedia sources
—
for which these measures
are not as well suited, professional judgment necessarily played a greater role in selection.
Quality.
While it is possible to ha
ve high
-
complexity texts of low inherent quality, the work
group solicited only texts of recognized value. From the pool of submissions gathered from
outside contributors, the work group selected classic or historically significant texts as well as
contemp
orary works of comparable literary merit, cultural significance, and rich content.
Range.
After identifying texts of appropriate complexity and quality, the work group applied
other criteria to ensure that the samples presented in each band represented as
broad a range
of sufficiently complex, high
-
quality texts as possible. Among the factors considered were initial
publication date, authorship, and subject matter.
Copyright and Permissions
For those exemplar texts not in the public domain, we secured permi
ssions and in some cases employed
a conservative interpretation of fair use, which allows limited, partial use of copyrighted text for a
nonprofit educational purpose as long as that purpose does not impair the rights holder’s ability to seek
a fair return
for his or her work. In instances where we could not employ fair use and have been unable
to secure permission, we have listed a title without providing an excerpt. Thus, some s
hort texts are not
excerpted here, as even short passages from them would cons
titute a substantial portion of the entire
work. In addition, illustrations
and other graphics in texts are generally not reproduced here. Such visual
elements are particularly important in texts for the youngest students and in many informational texts
fo
r readers of all ages. (Using the qualitative criteria outlined in Appendix A, the work group considered
the importance and complexity of graphical elements when placing texts in bands.)

OREGON COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS FOR English Language Arts
& Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects
When excerpts appear, they serve only as stand
-
ins for the full text
. The Standards require that students
engage with appropriately complex literary and informational works; such complexity is best found in
whole texts rather than passages from such texts.
Please note that these texts are included solely as exemplars in s
upport of the Standards. Any additional
use of those texts that are not in the public domain, such as for classroom use or curriculum
development, requires independent permission from the rights holders. The texts may not be copied or
distributed in any wa
y other than as part of the overall Common Core State Standards Initiative
documents.
