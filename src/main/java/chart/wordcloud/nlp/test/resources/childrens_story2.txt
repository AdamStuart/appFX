Mwindo grew up. A day went by, a week, a month, and he was grown. Then he said, “O my aunt, thank you for caring for me. Now I go to fight my father.”

His aunt said, “What is this talk? Your father’s village is huge. He has many men to fight for him. You cannot fight your father.”

But Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father did not want me.
    My father tried to kill me.
    Now he must fight me.

His aunt said, “All right, then. But I will go with you. And let us first visit your mother’s brothers, the blacksmiths. They will forge you, so no weapon can pierce you.”

Mwindo and his aunt started off. Iyangura brought her servants and the musicians and drummers of her village. They all sang and danced as they went.

They reached the village of Mwindo’s uncles, the blacksmiths. Mwindo said, “O my uncles, my father tried to kill me. Now I go to fight him. Forge me, so no weapon can pierce me.”

His uncles stoked the fire. They took Mwindo apart in pieces—his arms, his legs, his trunk, his head. They put the pieces in the fire. They hammered them on the forge.

They put Mwindo back together. His body was like iron. No weapon could pierce it.

Mwindo said, “Now I go to fight my father.”

His uncles told him, “The village of She-Mwindo is huge. He has many men to fight for him. Let us go and help you.”

They started to his father’s village. The uncles brought their servants and the musicians and drummers of their village. They all sang and danced as they went.

They came to the foot of the mountain, below the village of Tubondo. Iyangura said, “O my nephew, there are many of us. We have come a long way, singing and dancing. Now we are hungry. But we have no food! What can we do?”

Mwindo said, “O my aunt, you have fed me all my life. My father has not fed me. Now he will give us what he owes me.”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    Bananas of my father, come to me.
    Beans of my father, come to me.
    Pumpkins of my father, come to me.
    Chickens of my father, come to me.
    Goats of my father, come to me.
    Pots of my father, come to me.
    Firewood of my father, come to me.
    Dishes of my father, come to me.

Up the mountain, She-Mwindo saw things rise up and fly away—his bananas, his beans, his pumpkins, his chickens, his goats, his pots, his firewood, his dishes. He cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What is this?”

The things flew down the mountain to Mwindo. Everyone had a great feast. No one was hungry.

Mwindo said, “Now I go to fight my father.”

His uncles said, “Let us go there before you.”

The uncles went up to the village with their weapons. They entered the gate. They said, “Fight, O men of Tubondo!”

The men of Tubondo fought. All the uncles died. Their bodies lay in the dust.

Down the mountain, Mwindo said, “Where are my uncles?”

Hawk flew down. “O Mwindo, all your uncles are dead. The men of Tubondo have killed them.”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father did not want me.
    My father tried to kill me.
    He did not kill me,
    but he killed my uncles.
    Now he will fight Mwindo.
    Again he will try to kill me.
    But what can he do against me?

Mwindo danced up to the village. He had no weapon. He danced through the gate.

The chief said, “Who is this strange fellow? Should we kill him?”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    O my father, you did not want me.
    O my father, you tried to kill me.
    You did not kill me,
    but you killed my uncles.
    Now you will fight Mwindo.
    Again you will try to kill me.
    But what can you do against me?

She-Mwindo trembled. “O men of Tubondo, throw your spears! Shoot your arrows!”

The men of Tubondo threw their spears and shot their arrows. The spears and arrows struck Mwindo and bounced off. His body was like iron. No weapon could pierce it.

She-Mwindo cried out. “Aieeeeeee! What kind of man is this?” He ran away to his house.

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    O Lightning, look here.
    O Lightning, be the judge.
    Is my father right?
    Is Mwindo right?
    O Lightning, send your bolt.
    Show who’s right,
    show who’s wrong.

Lightning sent his bolt. It struck the men of Tubondo. The men died. Their bodies lay in the dust.

The chief saw from his house. He trembled and shook. “What a powerful man is Mwindo! What a mistake to reject him! But how can I now face him? He will kill me!”

Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    Lightning looked here.
    Lightning was the judge.
    He showed who’s right,
    he showed who’s wrong.

Iyangura came up to the village. She saw the bodies lying in the dust. “What is this? O my nephew, you came to fight your father. But now all these people are dead—your uncles and the men of Tubondo!”

Mwindo stopped dancing. He was sad to see everyone dead.

He went to one man. He swatted him with his conga—once, twice, three times. He said, “First you sleep, now you wake.”

The man woke up. He said, “What a great man is Mwindo! What can anyone do against you?”

Mwindo went to all the men. He swatted them with his conga—once, twice, three times. “First you sleep, now you wake.”

All the men woke up. All the men said, “What a great man is Mwindo! What can anyone do against you?”

Mwindo said, “Where is my father?”

Hawk flew down. “O Mwindo, your father ran out the other gate. He came to a kikoka fern. He pulled it up by the roots and crawled through the hole. Now he is underground, in the land of the gods. He goes to the village of their chief—Nyamurairi, god of fire.”

Mwindo said, “I go to bring home my father.”

Iyangura said, “What is this talk? No one can do this. Only the dead go there, and none return.”

But Mwindo sang and danced and waved his conga.

    I am Mwindo,
    the one born walking,
    the one born talking.
    My father did not want me.
    My father tried to kill me.
    Now he runs away.
    But how can he escape me?
    My father goes to the gods.
    Mwindo goes there too.
    Mwindo goes where he wants to go.
    The son will find his father.
    The father will face his son.
