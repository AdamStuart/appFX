  Shortly after the cooperative is incorporated, the members adopt a set of bylaws. Bylaws provide a detailed description of the structure and method of operation of the cooperative. Bylaws are a working plan for how the association should function.
        Most incorporation laws give members flexibility to structure their cooperative as they see fit. Most references to bylaws are permissive, giving members the authority to write their own rules on how to handle a particular issue.
        Bylaws normally are not filed with the State. But like the articles, they are treated in a manner similar to statutes by the courts. Failure of the leadership to follow the bylaws can also lead to legal liability.
        Numerous provisions are usually found in cooperative bylaws. Some are similar to those included in bylaws of for-profit corporations, others are unique to cooperation. The most common provisions are discussed in this report. But a cooperative is free to place virtually any rule on the conduct of its affairs in the bylaws, provided the provision doesn't conflict with an applicable law or the articles of incorporation.
        While almost any activity can be covered by a bylaw, only broad issues of long-term significance to members should be the subject of a bylaw. Operating decisions should not be covered in the bylaws, but rather in board policy resolutions. Board policies are directives to the management, issued by the board in its role as policymaker for the cooperative, that can be changed to reflect changing conditions at any time by the board. For example, whether the cooperative will do business with nonmembers is a general, long-term decision that should be covered in the bylaws. How nonmembers will be charged to insure that they pay their fair share of cooperative expenses is a short-term decision requiring the flexibility possible under a policy statement.

Membership

        The first bylaw usually states the qualifications to be a member of the cooperative. Membership should be limited to persons who will patronize the cooperative. For an agricultural cooperative, this means membership should be limited to producers of agricultural products and other farmer cooperative associations. Limiting the membership to producers and producer cooperatives is essential if the association wants to qualify for the limited antitrust protection of the Capper-Volstead Act, or for tax treatment under section 521 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the cooperative is incorporated under a State law that requires that members be agricultural producers.
        This bylaw may also include other reasonable prerequisites to membership, such as agreeing to purchase a share of stock, sign a marketing agreement, and patronize the association on a regular basis.
        This bylaw should also provide for the orderly termination of a membership. This can be particularly important for an agricultural cooperative. The significant legal privileges listed above are only available to associations of producers. This requirement is only met if the membership of anyone who stops farming is revoked.
        When a membership is terminated, it is a good practice to return the purchase price of the voting share of common stock, or the membership fee in a nonstock cooperative (but not necessarily the retained patronage investments). This makes it clear to the former member that the termination was more than a symbolic gesture and that he or she no longer has the right to participate in the policymaking of the association.
        This sample language is written for a stock cooperative. In a nonstock cooperative, appropriate references to membership certificates and fees would be substituted for the terms common stock and purchase price.

    ARTICLE I. MEMBERSHIP

                Section 1. Qualifications. Any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association, including both landlord and tenant in share tenancies, who is a bona fide producer of agricultural products in the territory in which the association is engaged in business, and who agrees to be a patron of the association, signs a marketing agreement with the association, purchases one share of common stock, and meets such other conditions as may be prescribed by the board of directors, may become a member of the association.
                All applications for membership must be approved by the board of directors. Member status is effective as of the time the board approves the application for membership.

                Section 2. Suspension or Termination. In the event the board of directors of the association shall find, following a hearing, that any of the common stock of this association has come into the hands of any person who is not eligible for membership, or that the holder thereof has ceased to be an eligible member, or that such holder has not marketed through the association the products covered by a marketing agreement with the association, or not otherwise patronized the association for a period of (_) year(s), or otherwise violated the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or other agreements made with the association, the association may suspend such holder's rights as a member and terminate the membership.
                When a membership is terminated, the association shall repurchase the member's share of common stock for par value. The holder shall return to the association the certificate evidencing the holder's share of stock. If such holder fails to deliver the certificate, the association may cancel such certificate on its books and records, and the certificate is then null and void.
                A suspended or terminated member shall have no rights or privileges on account of any stock held, nor vote or voice in the management or affairs of the association other than the right to participate in accordance with law in case of dissolution.

Meetings of Members

        A cooperative is owned and controlled by its members. A bylaw sets out the ground rules for convening the members to exercise their control function.
        An annual meeting is held each year to elect directors, review past performance and future plans, and conduct other business as needed.
        It is often a good idea to set the time of the annual meeting as promptly as possible after the end of the fiscal year. This encourages management to close the books for the year in a timely fashion and the auditor to review financial results and issue the audit report without delay. Also, the members are still focusing on last year's performance. If the annual meeting is delayed too long, the members are often into another production cycle and not able to properly exercise their control over the cooperative.
        This bylaw should also authorize special member meetings to handle any business that can't wait until the next annual meeting.
        Members should receive sufficient advance notice so they can plan to attend meetings. Many incorporation statutes have specific minimum notice requirements, both in terms of lead time (often 10 days or 2 weeks) and method (direct mail, publication in local newspaper). Associations incorporated under such a law must make sure the bylaw provides at least as much notice as the statute requires, and that appropriate notice is actually given. Otherwise any action taken at the meeting may be open to legal challenge.
        A statement on how voting will be conducted is also appropriate in this bylaw. How many votes each member will have is only one aspect of this issue. The draft language limits each member to one vote. If proportional voting is used, a description of how members will qualify for multiple votes, and a limit, if any, on the number of votes any one member can accumulate, should be substituted in the applicable place.
        Language on voting on behalf of members organized as partnerships and corporations can avoid an embarassing dispute right before or even during a membership meeting over how such a member will vote on an issue. Many cooperatives have members organized as partnerships or corporations designate, in writing, who will cast the member's vote, and that person alone can vote for the member until the member provides a valid written notice of a change in the designee.
        Other topics that should be addressed include proxy voting, voting by mail, and cumulative voting. There is no "right" way to handle these matters, although cumulative voting is usually prohibited. Sometimes the incorporation statute discusses proxy voting and voting by mail. Many cooperatives that permit proxy voting limit the number of proxies a member can vote, often to only one. If voting by mail is allowed, it is often limited to issues discussed in the meeting notice.
        Finally, the minimum number of members that need be present to conduct business, called a quorum, should be specified. If the statute permits, quorum requirements are frequently set low (e.g., 10 members or 10 percent of the membership, whichever is greater) so meetings will not have to be adjourned for lack of a quorum. While this exposes the association to control by an active minority, it is sometimes necessary in order to make sure that any business is conducted at all.
