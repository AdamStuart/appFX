Dangerous Beast or Cuddly Critter?

Everybody has his or her own preferences when it comes to everything. Food, colors, clothing, and animals are in this individual spectrum. Every animal deserves a piece of my heart, but some more than others. The animal with the biggest share is an odd creature, the Goblin shark. I only learned of it via a hand-drawing in a book about sea-life. This creature is a mysterious being that has been around longer than modern mankind. It has a face only a mother could love. The habits of the Goblin shark’s everyday life are clouded over with smoke. What is there that we can learn and how much?

Nobody has seen a Goblin shark in perfect physical condition. Its environment [home] is in deep-sea trenches, where only deep-sea submersibles can search. But, whenever one is caught in a net, people can get a glimpse of the shark before it dies. There are two reasons they die: one, the sharks get caught in the nets and two, the rapid change in pressure makes the sharks internal organs explode.

Additionally, the Goblin shark suits its name well. It has a tail that is shaped like a steak knife with a rounded tip. It also has a long, protruding snout that is much longer than any other cartilaginous fish. The Goblin shark is pink because its skin is so thin, you can see the blood vessels. At the beginning of its mouth, the teeth are sharp and thick. Near the end of the mouth, the teeth are long and spindly. The Goblin shark is very sluggish at swimming.

Now, a Goblin shark has a lot to do in a day. The animal has an odd feature that involves the jaw attached to another bone similar to the jaw. This allows the jaw to stretch out from its face. So, when hunting, its mouth shoots out and snatches its prey. The Goblin shark sways its head so the ampullae of Lorenzini can search for prey.  Occasionally, they come closer to the surface for more food opportunities. Nothing else is really known about this creature.

To conclude, this is a creature about which there are only a few bits of information. The Goblin shark’s appearance could be called a form of stark beauty. Its daily life is foggy and mysterious in our eyes. This creature is a good example of a living relic, an animal that has been around before man and has barely changed. This creature is an enigma, a mystery in a world of discoveries.

P.S. Thanks to the Science Channel and The Quest for the Goblin Shark. These were the resources I used for research information.
